can i  know  what are  the tools and technoalgies are used in this project  and what the role of  them, 2. how exactly the ids will work explain me detaily on what basis the  system detects  the  maliceous , dangaours packets

I'll explain the technologies used in this project and how the IDS detection system works in detail.

Configuration Files
PostCSS - CSS processing tool
Role: Processes Tailwind CSS and adds vendor prefixes
Various TypeScript configs - Different compilation settings for app vs build tools
2. How the IDS Detection System Works
The Intrusion Detection System uses multiple detection algorithms to identify malicious network traffic. Let me break down each detection method:

A. Blacklist-Based Detection

const BLACKLISTED_IPS = new Set([
  '203.0.113.666', '198.51.100.999', '192.0.2.999', '10.0.0.666',
  '172.16.1.999', '185.220.101.42', '91.189.89.199', '185.234.218.7'
]);
How it works:

Maintains a database of known malicious IP addresses
Every incoming packet's source IP is checked against this blacklist
If match found → Immediate HIGH severity alert
Real-world basis: Security companies maintain threat intelligence feeds with known bad IPs
B. Payload Analysis (Signature-Based Detection)

const SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS = [
  /SELECT.*FROM.*WHERE/i,        // SQL Injection
  /\.\.\/.*\/etc\/passwd/i,      // Path Traversal
  /<script.*>.*<\/script>/i,     // XSS Attack
  /UNION.*SELECT/i,              // SQL Injection
  /cmd\.exe/i,                   // Command Injection
  /powershell\.exe/i,            // PowerShell attacks
  /wget.*http/i,                 // Download malicious files
  /nc\s+-e/i,                    // Netcat reverse shell
];
How it works:

Pattern Matching: Each packet payload is scanned using regular expressions
Attack Signatures: Looks for known attack patterns like:
SQL Injection: SELECT * FROM users WHERE patterns
XSS: <script> tags in HTTP requests
Command Injection: cmd.exe, powershell.exe execution attempts
Path Traversal: ../../../etc/passwd directory traversal
Severity: CRITICAL alert if malicious payload detected
C. Port Scanning Detection (Behavioral Analysis)

private checkPortScanning(packet: NetworkPacket, alerts: ThreatAlert[]) {
  if (!this.portScanTracker.has(packet.sourceIP)) {
    this.portScanTracker.set(packet.sourceIP, new Set());
  }
  
  const ports = this.portScanTracker.get(packet.sourceIP)!;
  ports.add(packet.destinationPort);
  
  // If more than 20 different ports accessed, flag as port scan
  if (ports.size > 20) {
    // Generate HIGH severity alert
  }
}
How it works:

Tracking: Monitors each source IP and tracks which destination ports they access
Threshold: If an IP accesses more than 20 different ports quickly
Detection Logic: Normal users don't scan many ports; attackers do reconnaissance
Real-world basis: Port scans are common first step in network attacks
D. Unauthorized Protocol Detection

const UNAUTHORIZED_PROTOCOLS = new Map<number, string>([
  [21, 'FTP'],      // File Transfer (often insecure)
  [23, 'Telnet'],   // Unencrypted remote access
  [135, 'RPC'],     // Windows RPC (attack vector)
  [139, 'NetBIOS'], // Windows file sharing
  [445, 'SMB'],     // Windows file sharing
  [1433, 'MSSQL'],  // Database access
  [3389, 'RDP']     // Remote Desktop
]);
How it works:

Policy Enforcement: Defines which protocols/ports shouldn't be used
Detection: Flags any traffic to these "forbidden" ports
Security Rationale: These protocols are often:
Unencrypted (Telnet, FTP)
High-value targets (RDP, SQL)
Common attack vectors (SMB, RPC)
E. DDoS Detection (Volume-Based Analysis)

private checkDDoSPatterns(packet: NetworkPacket, alerts: ThreatAlert[]) {
  const currentTime = Date.now();
  const key = `${packet.sourceIP}_${Math.floor(currentTime / 1000)}`;
  
  this.requestFrequency.set(key, (this.requestFrequency.get(key) || 0) + 1);
  
  // If more than 100 requests per second from same IP
  if (this.requestFrequency.get(key)! > 100) {
    // Generate CRITICAL alert
  }
}
How it works:

Rate Limiting: Counts packets per second from each IP
Threshold: More than 100 packets/second = suspicious
Time Windows: Uses sliding window approach
Cleanup: Removes old tracking data to prevent memory leaks
3. Detection Algorithm Flow

Incoming Packet
       ↓
1. Blacklist Check → If match: HIGH Alert
       ↓
2. Payload Analysis → If suspicious pattern: CRITICAL Alert
       ↓
3. Protocol Check → If unauthorized port: MEDIUM Alert
       ↓
4. Port Scan Check → If >20 ports: HIGH Alert
       ↓
5. DDoS Check → If >100 req/sec: CRITICAL Alert
       ↓
6. Log & Display Alert
4. Alert Severity Levels
CRITICAL: Immediate threats (malicious payloads, DDoS)
HIGH: Serious threats (blacklisted IPs, port scans)
MEDIUM: Policy violations (unauthorized protocols)
LOW: Suspicious but not immediately dangerous
5. Real-World IDS Comparison
This simulation mimics real IDS systems like:

Snort: Uses signature-based detection (like our payload analysis)
Suricata: Combines signatures with behavioral analysis
OSSEC: Host-based intrusion detection
Zeek: Network analysis and behavioral detection
6. Limitations & Real-World Considerations
Current Limitations:

Simulated data (not real network traffic)
Simple pattern matching (real systems use ML)
No encrypted traffic analysis
Basic behavioral analysis
Real IDS Systems Also Include:

Machine learning for anomaly detection
Deep packet inspection
Protocol analysis
Geolocation-based filtering
Integration with threat intelligence feeds
False positive reduction algorithms
The system demonstrates core IDS concepts while being educational and visually impressive for portfolio purposes!
